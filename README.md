# Functionality
When the planner is openned, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
When scrolled down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

Then the user can click into a time block and enter an event they choose 
When clicked on the save button on the right for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
When the page is refreshed, nothing is lost and your events are still current.
